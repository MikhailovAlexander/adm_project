## 1. Business modeling
The equestrian center is ...

The company has two areas of activity:
1. Horse keeping service
2. Horse riding service
### 1.1. Use case diagram
The use-case diagram for the equestrian center was developed to identify the main processes and actors. Diagram was created using the Visual Paradigm modeling tool.

Action diagrams have been developed for the main cases from the use case diagram.

### 1.2. Diagrams for the horse keeping actions:

## 2. Conceptual modeling
A conceptual data model is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships used to model the organization of data in databases or information systems. 
This model represents the basic entities for the equestrian center. The model created with VisualParadigm as a data modeling tool.

## 3. CRUD Matrix designing
### 3.1. Processes defining
Processes of the equestrian center:
- ... 
- ...
### 3.2. Resources defining
Resources of the equestrian center:
- ... 
- ...
### 3.3. Roles defining
Roles of the equestrian center:
- ... 
- ...
### 3.4. Data CRUD Matrix for the equestrian center
### 3.5. Resources CRUD Matrix for the equestrian center
### 3.6. Process CRUD Matrix for the equestrian center
## 4. Logical modeling
The logical ER-diagram is a detailed version of the conceptual ER-diagram. The logical ER model is designed to enrich the conceptual model by explicitly defining columns in each entity and introducing operational and transactional entities. The logical data model is independent of the actual database system.

## 5. Physical modeling
### 5.1. Choosing a database management system
Postgresql, the world's most advanced open source relational database, was chosen as the database management system for the project.

Russian developers participate in the development of Postgresql, there is a Russian version of Postgres PRO that meets the requirements of the Russian Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.

### 5.2. Physical data modeling
PgModeler, an open-source, multiplatform database modeler for PostgreSQL, was chosen as the data modeling tool.
